Subqueries.


 1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named 
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

-->select onum from orders where cnum = ( select cnum from customers where cname ='Cisneros');
 
2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have 
above-average orders. 

-->  select cname, rating from customers, orders where orders.cnum=customers.cnum  and amt  > (select avg(amt) from orders);


3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for 
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

--> 	select sname, sum(amt) as tota_Amount from salespeople, orders 
	where  salespeople.snum=orders.snum 
	group by sname 
	having sum(amt) >  
			  ( select       max(amt) from orders);
