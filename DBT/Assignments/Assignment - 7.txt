Assignment - 7  ---------- Summarizing Data with Aggregate Functions-----------

aggregate functions are - 5 (main aggregate functions)

1)count()
2)sum()
3)avg()
4)min()
5)max()


Additionally, some databases may support more advanced aggregate functions or variations, such as:

GROUP_CONCAT() (in MySQL): Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.
ARRAY_AGG() (in PostgreSQL): Aggregates values into an array.
STRING_AGG() (in SQL Server and PostgreSQL): Concatenates string values with a specified delimiter.




1) Write a query that counts all orders for October 3. 
-->  select count(*) from orders where month(odate)=10 and day(odate)=03;

2) Write a query that counts the number of different non-NULL city values in the 
Customers table. 
--> select count(distinct city) from customers where city is not null;

3) Write a query that selects each customerâ€™s smallest order. 
--> select cnum , min(Amt) as smallest_order from orders group by cnum;

4) Write a query that selects the first customer, in alphabetical order, whose name 
begins with G. 
--> select cname from customers where cname like 'G%' order by cname limit 1;

5) Write a query that selects the highest rating in each city. 
--> select city , max(rating) from customers group by city; //ok
     select city , max(rating) as Highest_salary from customers group by city;

6) Write a query that counts the number of salespeople registering orders for each 
day. (If a salesperson has more than one order on a given day, he or she should be 
counted only once.).
--> select odate , count(distinct snum ) as unique_salespeople from orders group by odate;
