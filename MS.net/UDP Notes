What is UDP? 
ans -> UDP is a connectionless and lightweight transport layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite. It allows applications to send messages, called datagrams, without establishing a prior connection, 
      making it suitable for scenarios where speed is crucial and occasional data loss is acceptable.

Key Features : - 

# Connectionless Communication: UDP does not establish a handshake before data transmission, reducing overhead and latency.

# No Guarantee of Delivery: There is no assurance that messages will arrive at their destination, nor are they guaranteed to arrive in order.

# Minimal Overhead: With a simple header structure, UDP adds minimal overhead, facilitating faster data transfer.

# No Congestion Control: UDP lacks built-in mechanisms to manage network congestion, allowing for continuous data flow but increasing the risk of packet loss 
  during high traffic.

# Common Use Cases

UDP is ideal for applications where speed is more critical than reliability:

# Live Video and Audio Streaming: Ensures minimal delay, even if some data packets are lost.

# Online Gaming: Provides fast transmission of game state updates.

# Voice over IP (VoIP): Facilitates real-time voice communication with low latency.

# Domain Name System (DNS) Queries: Allows quick resolution of domain names to IP addresses.

# Limitations :- 

# Unreliable Transmission: No mechanisms for retransmission of lost packets.

# Security Concerns: Susceptible to spoofing and amplification attacks due to lack of connection verification.

# Not Suitable for Critical Data: Applications requiring guaranteed delivery should use protocols like TCP.
